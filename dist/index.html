  <strong>Description:</strong>
  <p>
Annoying Sounds is the ultimate prankster’s toolbox for harmless mischief and endless laughs. This project features a growing collection of realistic, hard-to-trace sounds designed to confuse, distract, and mildly torment your friends, family, coworkers, or classmates.

Using a Bluetooth speaker or any audio-capable device, you can play sounds at random intervals that make people question their sanity while they hunt for the source. From persistent crickets and croaking frogs to the dreaded low-battery smoke alarm chirp, these sounds blend seamlessly into real-world environments—making them nearly impossible to track down.

Perfect for pranks, experiments in patience, or lighthearted chaos, Annoying Sounds turns everyday environments into a puzzle that can keep people searching for hours. Use responsibly, prank creatively, and enjoy the confusion.

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong>
<p>Use at your own risk. Seriously.
We are not responsible for confused roommates, suspicious coworkers, annoyed teachers, or family members crawling around the house trying to find “that sound.”

Tempers may flare. Sanity may be questioned. Friendships may be temporarily tested.
Extended exposure could result in eye-rolling, dramatic sighs, furniture being moved, and someone declaring, “I swear I heard it again!”

Annoying Sounds is meant for harmless fun and legendary pranks—please use common sense, know your audience, and don’t deploy sounds where safety, sleep, or actual smoke alarms matter. If chaos ensues… that part’s on you.

Prank responsibly. Or at least… creatively.</p>
